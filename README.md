# compose-richtext

A collection of Compose libraries for working with rich text formatting and documents. This repo
is currently very experimental and really just proofs-of-concept: there are no tests and some things
might be broken or very non-performant.

```kotlin
@Composable fun App() {
  val printController = rememberPrintableController()

  Printable(printController) {
    RichText(Modifier.background(color = Color.White)) {
      Heading(0, "Title")
      Text("Summary paragraph.")

      HorizontalRule()

      BlockQuote {
        Text("A wise person once saidâ€¦")
      }
    }
  }

  Button(onClick = { printController.print("README") }) {
    Text("PRINT ME")
  }
}
```
