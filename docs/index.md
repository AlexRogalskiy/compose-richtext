# Overview

Compose Richtext is a collection of Compose libraries for working with rich text formatting and
documents.

Each library is documented separately, see the navigation menu for the list. This site also includes
an API reference.

!!! warning
    This project is currently very experimental and mostly just a proof-of-concept at this point.
    There are no tests and some things might be broken or very non-performant.

    The API may also change between releases without deprecation cycles.
